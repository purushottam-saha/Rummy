# Rummy
This project contains rummy strategies and hand evaluation metrics such as Minscore and mindist, and a gym for strategies to take on one another. Look at example.py for usages.

This code is used to run large scale simulations across strategies, which is used in "Quantitative Rule-Based Strategy modeling in Classic Indian Rummy: A Metric Optimization Approach" by Saha et. al. (Manuscript under review).
